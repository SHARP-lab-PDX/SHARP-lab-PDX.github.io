      Neilson LE, **Montaño I**, May JL, **Sicard S**, Cho Y, Iliff JJ, **Elliott JE, Lim MM**, Scott GD. Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Positive Airway Pressure, and Implications of Early Treatment in Parkinson Disease. *JAMA Neurol.* 2026;83(1):68–75. doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.4691
    summary: In this electronic health record–based cohort study of more than 11
      million veterans with mean (SD) of 4.9 (1.8) years of follow-up, OSA was
      associated with incident PD, even after adjusting for competing risk of
      death, age, body mass index, and comorbidity burden. This risk was
      attenuated by OSA treatment with positive airway pressure.
