  - question: How do I get a letter of recommendation?
    answer: |-
      SHARP leadership is happy to write letters of recommendation or serve as a professional reference for students, research assistants, and any other members of the team. A few guidelines to follow in order to ensure a positive experience for everyone involved:

      1. Wait until the person knows you well before you ask for a letter.
      2. Ask the person, “Do you feel comfortable writing me a strong letter of recommendation?” Otherwise, you risk getting a negative, neutral, or only lukewarm letter.
      3. Give the person sufficient notice (e.g. at least 4 weeks) and a thorough description (preferably written) of what opportunity the letter is for and what you hope to gain from the opportunity. For professional references, please provide as much notice as possible along with information on the position and what you hope to gain from it.
      4. Specify to whom the letter should be addressed, what (if any) specific instructions there are to follow for content and submission, and when it is due.
      5. A brief outline/draft of suggested bullet points/highlights that you the person to include is ALWAYS appreciated. The person may not remember what you did in the lab X number of months or years ago. A copy of your CV is always helpful.

  - question: What if I realize that research is not for me?
    answer: |-
      All SHARP employees start with a 3-4 month temporary trial period in the lab while they finalize their onboarding requirements. Continued employment after the trial period is contingent on both a positive performance review and a desire to continue in this field of research. We encourage new employees to continue to look for positions that are a good fit during this time and will always support any decisions to move on to other areas. Most positions within SHARP are intended to be career or academic stepping stones and we encourage folks to have open and honest conversations with their managers about their interests and future goals!
