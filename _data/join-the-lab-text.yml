internships: |-
  We seek highly motivated, detail oriented, analytical, and creative people who are enthusiastic about learning about sleep and neuroscience in a fast-paced laboratory setting. Summer internships are available by application through the following programs:

  * PVARF summer internship program (posted in Feb/March each year [here](https://pvarf.applicantpro.com/jobs))
  * OHSU Occupational Health Sciences Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)
  * University of Oregon Human Physiology Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)

  Training will be provided for all techniques, but candidates are expected to be self-starters. Strong candidates will be highly organized workers who are comfortable working both independently and in team dynamics and are enthusiastic about behavioral neuroscience research. There may be opportunities for exceptional interns to be re-interviewed after completion of their summer program for consideration as full-time employees. Prior research experience is a plus but not required. Positions are in person with occasional telework where appropriate.
