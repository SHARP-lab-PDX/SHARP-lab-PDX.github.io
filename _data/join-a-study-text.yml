  Our work could not exist without the efforts of research participants who volunteer for our studies, giving us both their trust and time so that we may better understand the nature of sleep, chronic pain, and memory problems. We treat all our research participants with respect, dignity and gratitude for the critical role they play in our work. We are committed to providing a safe, caring, professional environment for our subjects.
