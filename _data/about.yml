  **We seek to understand the neuroscience of sleep, and how this can be
  optimized to improve quality of life in health and disease.**


  We work closely with the community to improve quality of life through our cutting edge research. Our science serves a number of stakeholders, including Veterans and other affected patients, clinicians, the scientific community, and the general public.


  Through our research, we hope to discover new therapies for *TBI, PTSD, chronic pain, neurodevelopmental disorders and dementia.*
human-methods: >-
  Polysomnography in the sleep clinic or at home


  MRI scans of the brain


  Randomized clinical trials testing dietary supplements and other lifestyle based interventions to improve sleep, pain, memory and/or mood.


  Monitoring of activity and sleep using wristwatch-based devices, bed mats, light sensors, and/or other unobtrusive sensors in the home


  Survey-based questionnaires


  Reaction time and memory testing


  Saliva and/or blood collection
