        <p>We seek highly motivated, detail oriented, analytical, and creative people who are enthusiastic about
            learning about
            sleep and neuroscience in a fast-paced laboratory setting. Summer internships are available by
            application through the
            following programs:

        <ul>
            <li>PVARF summer internship program (posted in Feb/March each year <a
                    href="https://pvarf.applicantpro.com/jobs"
                    class="bold blueish-black text-decoration-underline">here</a>)</li>
            <li>OHSU Occupational Health Sciences Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)</li>
            <li>University of Oregon Human Physiology Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)</li>
        </ul>


        Training will be provided for all techniques, but candidates are expected to be self-starters. Strong
        candidates will be
        highly organized workers who are comfortable working both independently and in team dynamics and are
        enthusiastic about
        behavioral neuroscience research. There may be opportunities for exceptional interns to be re-interviewed
        after
        completion of their summer program for consideration as full-time employees. Prior research experience is a
        plus but not
        required. Positions are in person with occasional telework where appropriate.
