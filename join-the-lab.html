        <p>We seek highly motivated, detail oriented, analytical, and creative people who are enthusiastic about
            learning about
            sleep and neuroscience in a fast-paced laboratory setting. Summer internships are available by
            application through the
            following programs:

        <ul>
            <li>PVARF summer internship program (posted in Feb/March each year <a
                    href="https://pvarf.applicantpro.com/jobs"
                    class="bold blueish-black text-decoration-underline">here</a>)</li>
            <li>OHSU Occupational Health Sciences Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)</li>
            <li>University of Oregon Human Physiology Summer Internship program (posted in Jan/Feb each year)</li>
        </ul>


        Training will be provided for all techniques, but candidates are expected to be self-starters. Strong
        candidates will be
        highly organized workers who are comfortable working both independently and in team dynamics and are
        enthusiastic about
        behavioral neuroscience research. There may be opportunities for exceptional interns to be re-interviewed
        after
        completion of their summer program for consideration as full-time employees. Prior research experience is a
        plus but not
        required. Positions are in person with occasional telework where appropriate.

        </h1>
        <div class="col">
            <p class="bold">It's April or May and I'm still interested in doing a summer internship. Can I apply?
            </p>
            <p class="ms-3">Please inquire again next year. We get inquiries starting in December for application
                decisions between January-March.</p>
            <p class="bold">I live far away, but I will be in Portland this summer. Can I apply?
            </p>
            <p class="ms-3">The onboarding process is onerous and takes between 4-6 months to complete. Several
                steps are in person. If you are not
                able to accomplish this before your employment starts, then please inquire again next year.
            </p>
            <p class="bold">I am working full-time somewhere else, but am interested in exploring part-time work
                with SHARP. Should I apply?

            </p>
            <p class="ms-3">If you are highly motivated and committed, please apply through the job postings above
                and address this contingency
                during your interviews. We are flexible and have accommodated this in the past for exceptional
                candidates.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">How do I get a letter of recommendation?</p>
            <p class="ms-3">SHARP leadership is happy to write letters of recommendation or serve as a professional
                reference for students, research assistants, and any other members of the team. A few guidelines to
                follow in order to ensure a positive experience for everyone involved:
            <ol>
                <li>Wait until the person knows you well before you ask for a letter.</li>
                <li>Ask the person, “Do you feel comfortable writing me a strong letter of recommendation?”
                    Otherwise, you risk getting a negative, neutral, or only lukewarm letter.</li>
                <li>Give the person sufficient notice (e.g. at least 4 weeks) and a thorough description (preferably
                    written) of what opportunity the letter is for and what you hope to gain from the opportunity.
                    For professional references, please provide as much notice as possible along with information on
                    the position and what you hope to gain from it.</li>
                <li>Specify to whom the letter should be addressed, what (if any) specific instructions there are to
                    follow for content and submission, and when it is due.</li>
                <li>A brief outline/draft of suggested bullet points/highlights that you the person to include is
                    ALWAYS appreciated. The person may not remember what you did in the lab X number of months or
                    years ago. A copy of your CV is always helpful.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="bold">What if I realize that research is not for me?</p>
            <p class="ms-3">All SHARP employees start with a 3-4 month temporary trial period in the lab while they
                finalize their onboarding
                requirements. Continued employment after the trial period is contingent on both a positive
                performance review and a desire to continue in this field of research. We encourage new employees to
                continue to look for positions that are a good fit during this time and will always support any
                decisions to move on to other areas. Most positions within SHARP are intended to be career or
                academic stepping stones and we encourage folks to have open and honest conversations with their
                managers about their interests and future goals!
