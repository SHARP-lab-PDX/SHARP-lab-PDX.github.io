Cosette graduated in 2008 from Columbia University with a BA in Biology and Psychology. Her work in clinical research began as a student at Columbia University, when she started working for the Mothers and Newborns Study at the Mailman School of Public Health. After graduating, she continued working with the same cohort on studying the public health impacts of climate change and air pollution. She moved to Portland in 2013 and began working on the VA’s Central Studies Program, which concentrates on running multilocation studies at the VA’s clinics and hospitals around the nation. She joined SHARP as a Research Coordinator in 2021 after taking some time off to be a fulltime mother to her two children. When she isn’t coordinating research with SHARP, she enjoys Pacific Northwest adventures with her family. As an avid vegan baker, she enjoys bringing her creations to share with her wonderful coworkers. She also enjoys planning highly detailed parties for her kids, crafting, and reading/learning about everything.
