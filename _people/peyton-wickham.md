Peyton Wickham (NÃ©e: Teutsch) has an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from the University of Portland, and has been with SHARP since graduating in 2016. Since joining the lab her roles have evolved, but the core of her time has been in pursuit of better understanding the relationship between developmental sleep and social behavior, the interplay of sleep and trauma, and investigating therapeutic options in these preclinical models. She loves to be involved in research from the roots up, and her research interests center on translational rodent behavior models. When not in the lab, Peyton enjoys reading, gardening, and exploring food around Portland.
