Laura received her BS in Bioengineering at Oregon State University and currently splits her time between several labs at OHSU and the Portland VA including the Hoffman Lab (Drs. William Hoffman and Milky Kohno) where she has worked for over 10 years using multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to investigate the effects of methamphetamine and alcohol use disorders on brain, the Piantino Lab (Dr. Juan Piantino) comparing perivascular space (PVS) burden, functional MRI, and diffusion imaging across cohorts with sleep impairments and post-concussive syndrome and the SHARP Lab (Dr. Miranda Lim) where she is the lead coordinator at OHSU for the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) Consortium study. In her free time, Laura enjoys cuddle sessions with her mini dachshund, going to Timbers games, traveling, and spending time with her family and friends.
