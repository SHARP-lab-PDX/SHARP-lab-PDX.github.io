Darren earned his MS Biology in 2019 from Eastern Washington University where his focus was on interactions between the neurotransmitters dopamine and oxytocin. After completing his MS, he went on to receive his PhD in Experimental Psychology from Washington State University in 2023. The focus of his doctoral research was on neuronal development and endocannabinoid signaling, which is crucial for proper neuronal development during both fetal and adolescent developmental timepoints. At SHARP, Darren plans to continue exploring neurodevelopment, observing how early-life sleep disruptions impact social and reward seeking behaviors in adolescent and adult prairie voles. Outside of research, Darren is very passionate about teaching and educating the next group of potential scientists. At the schools his children have attend he has done outreach activities to teach children about the wonders of the brain. At the college level he has taught multiple psychology classes and human physiology laboratory classes, which he found to be extremely rewarding. On a personal level, Darren enjoys brewing beer and mead, experimenting with various hops, herbs, and fruits. He is also very enthusiastic about trivia, so you may find him at a local bar for trivia nights.
