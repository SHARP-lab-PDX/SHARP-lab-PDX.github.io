Savanah graduated with a BS in psychology, along with minors in biology and neuroscience, from Portland State University in 2023. As an undergraduate, she discovered her love for sleep science, specifically the psychological and physiological impacts of REM stage sleep, and wrote two research proposals on the treatment of nightmares. While in school, she worked in Dr. Tori Crains applied sleep research lab, supporting multiple projects in occupational health and I/O psychology. Savanah joined SHARP in the spring of 2023, with an interest in EEG data, sleep phenotyping, and the role that REM sleep plays in disease and cognitive function. In the future, she plans to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, and hopes to focus on the neural correlates of sleep and dreams. Outside of work, Savanah is an avid patron of the public library, gets lost in the woods about once a month, and enjoys crafting decorations out of scavenged materials.
