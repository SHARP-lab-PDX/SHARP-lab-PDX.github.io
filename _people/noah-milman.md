Noah graduated with a BS in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University in 2021. He was awarded the Alexander Skavenski Excellence in Neuroscience for his outstanding record in coursework, laboratory research, student leadership, and community service. During his time as an undergraduate, he spent two-plus years of full-time work in Dr. Li-Huei Tsai's lab at MIT, where he contributed to studies of non-invasive brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease, animal models of early-life stress and cognitive resilience. In the summer of 2021, he moved to Portland, OR on a long bike trip from Boston, MA. He joined the lab in spring of 2022, focusing on two main projects revolving around the importance of sleep across the lifespan. In the first, he uses overnight polysomnography from older adults in the WashU Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Sleep and EEG, to explore the global and regional connectivity of low frequency events as a potential novel biomarker for neurodegeneration. In the other, he investigates the role of early-life REM sleep in the display of affiliative behavior in prairie voles. Broadly, he is interested in the resilience promoting factors or interventions that lead to happier and healthier lives. Understanding the role of sleep is the first step of that research. Outside of lab, he loves to spend time outside, often riding his bike with friends. Previously he volunteered at the non-profit organization Bikes Not Bombs in Boston, MA, as a teacher for a community bike repair course. One day, he hopes to be a Professor at a primarily undergraduate institution.
