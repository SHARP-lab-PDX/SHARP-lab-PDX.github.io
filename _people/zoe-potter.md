Zoe graduated with Honors from Portland State University in 2023 with a BS in Psychology. She joined the SHARP lab in January of 2023 with plans to pursue a graduate degree in Psychology after a couple of years of working in research. Before pursuing this field, she worked in childcare as a KinderCare/Champions teacher. She loved working with kids and was inspired to join a research project at PSU that introduces social and emotional learning curriculums to Preschools. Zoe's research background also includes the prevention of sexual abuse within youth-serving organizations, and stigma and hiring bias within organizational contexts. She is currently interested in how trauma interacts with sex differences. When she's not in the lab, Zoe loves to snowboard, build Lego Technic cars, watch Formula 1 racing, and search for the greatest sushi restaurants.
