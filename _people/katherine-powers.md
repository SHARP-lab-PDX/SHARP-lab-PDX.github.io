Katherine graduated in 2001 with a BA in biology emphasizing neuropsychology. Her sleep career started with running home sleep studies for Dr. Hoddes' Medical Monitoring Services, later working as a sleep technologist at National Jewish MRC, coordinating MRI sleep studies for Dr. Rooney at the OHSU's AIRC, then culminating with joining the SHARP team in November 2020. Research has also been a focus of her work assisting bench and colony immunology research at Dr. Katie Haskins' lab at the University of Colorado in college and later providing over a decade of MR image analysis and clinical research coordination at Dr. Jack Simon's Portland VA laboratory and at the AIRC. She continues to be enthusiastic about advancing neuroscience on a daily basis. When not engaged in research activities, she records professional quality e-learning and meditation voice-overs; if you ask her nicely she may be persuaded to record one for you or your project. An avid tabletop gaming enthusiast, she also enjoys creating paintings in oil or pastel, and geeky crafting.
