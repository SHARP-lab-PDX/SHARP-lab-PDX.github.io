Kayla has an educational background in Psychology and received her BS in June of 2023. She graduated as a first-generation student and aims to pursue graduate school in the future. Kayla has been a member of the SHARP lab since June, 2022 and has prior experience working in trauma-informed research. She spent a year of her undergraduate studies volunteering in a lab that studied sexual violence prevention in youth serving organizations and college campuses. Throughout her professional experience, she has developed a passion for serving at-risk populations that suffer from PTSD. She's particularly interested in studying gender and sex differences among populations with PTSD. In her time outside the SHARP lab, she enjoys spending time traveling and exploring waterfalls with her 5-year-old American Pitbull Terrier. Kayla has also been an avid painter since she was a child and feels most inspired by dark romanticism and realism.
